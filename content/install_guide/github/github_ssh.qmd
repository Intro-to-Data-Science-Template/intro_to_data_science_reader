## Overview

## Creating SSH Keys and Adding to Github

**SSH Keys** are a way to identify your computer when accessing external resources. Think about it like a password for your computer to log in by itself. The first thing we need to do is create an SSH key for your computer. Open up R Studio, and click on the **Terminal** tab in the bottom left pane. Copy the following, enter your correct email, and press enter to create a key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`

The terminal will look slightly different in my pictures, but the process is the same in the R Studio terminal.

It will ask where you want to save the key. Accept the defaults by pressing **Enter**.

It will then ask you to create a pass phrase, press enter twice to skip this step.

It will then show a printout of your key, and a little bit of art. I've greyed mine out here for security.

Next, type `cd` and press enter, followed by `cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub`. It will print out a code starting with "ssh-ed25519 ... your_email@smith.edu." You want to highlight all of that, including the "ssh-ed25519" and your email, press CTRL or command + C to copy it.

We will now return to [github.com](https://github.com) and login.

On the next screen, click the green button in the upper right that says "New SSH Key."
