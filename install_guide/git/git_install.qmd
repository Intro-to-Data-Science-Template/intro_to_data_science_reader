## Overview

**git** is a tool for version control and collaboration. It is *the* tool used by data science teams big and small to keep track of code. Think of it like track changes in Word or Google docs, but for code files. 

## git on Windows

Follow these step-by-step instructions if you're installing Git on a Windows machine:

First, launch a web browser, the image below shows the Microsoft Edge browser.

## git on Mac

To install git on a Mac, first open the launchpad by pressing `F4` or by making a pinch motion on the track pad with three fingers and your thumb.

A terminal window will open up, showing your account name and then a `$`, with a flashing cursor afterwards. You will enter text here to issue commands.

A prompt will appear asking you to agree to the license agreement, click **Agree**.

![](img/05.png "license agreement")

The software will then start installing. It will take a few minutes to finish. When it is done you will see the following window. Click **Done**.

To make sure eveything is installed correctly, go back to the terminal window and enter `git` once again. You should see a long printout that looks similar to the following. If you do, everything worked!

Next we will need to set up some options.
