Their TeamLab Planets exhibit in Tokyo was one of the coolest things I have ever seen. It is an entire complex of large, interactive art that you walk through. One room was filled with ankle deep water that you waded through, while holographic fish swam by. If you touched any of the fish, they would explode into flowers. I also appreciate it from a technical perspective, as all the art is coded in Python.","Sunday","Sunday","Tuesday","Friday","Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday","Osaka, Japan","Fiction","Board/Card Games, Crafts, Tabletop Games (Pen and Paper games like Dungeons and Dragons), Video Games",TRUE,"Spike Spiegal_1"

However, my favorite form of media is probably books, so I'll just describe one that I like a lot. I really like the novel Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card. I first read it when I was about eleven or twelve (I have since read it at least twice and seen a movie adaptation), and I definitely associate it with the nostalgia of childhood. But that's certainly not the main reasonI've always enjoyed science fiction and literally any novel containing a well-developed plot and a skillful plot twist, as well as social satire and allegories. This work embodies all of those criteria, incorporating science, a structurally sound and intriguing narrative, and social critique. And on top of that, it accomplishes all this using a well-built world populated with well-developed characters, including the protagonist Ender, who is profoundly relatable and likable. It's the story of a brilliant child caught between a rock and a hard place, a story about war and morality, a story about space and other worlds and extinction and compassion across species. I love it.",NA,"Wednesday",NA,NA,NA,"New York City, New York","Non-fiction","Books, Crafts, Drawing, Hiking/Walking, Movies, Painting, Socializing, TV Series",FALSE,"Sherlock Holmes_3"
"Tiana",NA,"Purple",6,NA,"September",TRUE,FALSE,1,FALSE,6,"None","The song ""All Night"" by Beyonce is without a doubt my favorite song of all time. In my opinion, Beyonce is the best performer or all time, living or dead. Her choreography and overall stage presence is unmatched. Furthermore, she is one of the best vocalists of our time. Specifically, in ""All Night"" she gives us a calming song that still has a strong beat that one could bop to. The song has good vibes and versatility. It can be played at any type of event. Additionally, the background behind the lyrics is complex and further attests to Beyonce's incredible lyricism. Finally, ""All Night"" lives in Beyonce's most iconic album, Lemonade, which she made in response to her husband's infidelity. ""All Night"" perfectly captures how Beyonce can turn lemons into lemonade.",NA,"Saturday","Monday, Friday","Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday",NA,"Washington D.C.","Non-fiction","Athletics (Team), Music (Listening), Socializing, TV Series, Video Games",FALSE,"Tiana_4"
